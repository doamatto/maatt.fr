It has been 4 years, if my memory serves right, since I've used Jekyll. It was what this site (or more aptly, [doamatto.xyz](https://doamatto.xyz)) used to create a website that fit my needs.

Eventually I gave up on it and moved to Next.js because that's what everyone did once Next.js blew up, and was left unsatisfied. I could start a site build and then go make lunch. It would be ready about when I got back to the computer (even with Apple Silicon now). The thing I really hated, bar the speed it took to build and the girth of dependencies and issues with those, was how god awful it was to look at my own website. I have far from the best internet connection, even by U.S. standards, and I have god awful cell service because of [ye olde border war](https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/telecom-battle-at-the-border-intensifies-between-verizon-and-altan-redes/152389/) (take that Daniel!)
