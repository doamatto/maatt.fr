This site is hosted on a server in Iceland from [1984 Hosting](https://1984.is) using Caddy. It's built using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) and [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com) using a custom Makefile ([see source code here](https://github.com/doamatto/maatt.fr). I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) when working on it and Hemingway Writer and Grammarly for writing and proofreading.

This site was designed to work with screen readers and follow RGAA standards and guidelines. Both of these aid me personally. It only made sense to be strict requirements for this site. In addition to it, an abridged site is available for those with lower bandwidth at [https://lite.maatt.fr](https://lite.maatt.fr)â€” the content is identical, but it removes EVERYTHING that isn't essential: images, seasonal stylings, et al.

For those in the European Union or Germany wanting to know on a scale of 1-10 how compliant this site is with the law: the answer is a solid number. Which number? Great question. You can [view all relevant legal disclaimers here.](/legal/)
