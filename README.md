This utilises:
- **Zola** for page compilation,
- a self-hosted **Plausible** instance for analytics,
- **Vercel** for hosting; and:
- **GitHub Actions/SonarCloud** for code quality.

## Building
1. Install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)
2. Build the site (`zola build`)

If changing code, it's ideal to use an [editor config plugin.](https://editorconfig.org/)
