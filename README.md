# Personal Site [![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=doamatto_personal-site&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=doamatto_personal-site)

This utilises:
- **Zola** for page compilation,
- **1984** for hosting; and:
- **SonarCloud** for code quality.

## Building
1. Install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)
2. Build the site (`zola build`)

If changing code, it's ideal to use an [editor config plugin.](https://editorconfig.org/#download)
