            The User-Agent <code>PS Crawlerâ€” maatt.fr/ps-crawl</code> is for a web crawler that I made that makes automated GitHub issues for when a privacy policy may need to have its score updated. You can see the bot's source code <a href="https://github.com/doamatto/ps-crawl">on GitHub.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Opt-out of site crawling</h2>
        <p>
            You <i>can</i> use a robots.txt file to block the bot's user agent. It's not encouraged, but will be honored.
        </p>
        <h2>My site doesn't have a privacy policy</h2>
        <p>
            You can <a href="https://github.com/politiwatch/privacyspy">create a pull request removing your website from the <code>products/</code> folder.</a> Once that change is made, the bot should stop crawling your website permanently. This is the preferred solution rather than using a robots file, as it helps the bot get through more policies faster.
