The European Parliament released an update on its rules for waste treatment, specifically batteries. In addition to mandating certain percents of reused metals, parliament said that "portable batteries in appliances must be designed so that consumers can easily remove and replace them themselves." They also said that by 31 December 2030, the Commission will decide to phase out the use of non-rechargeable batteries altogether.

This is a MORE than welcome addition. It is a pain in the ass, put simply, to replace almost any phone's battery and I'm more than happy to see legislation letting me be able to have that ability without fear of breaking something in the process.
