Most all of FiveM's loading screen mods have been, in my experience, poor looking and poor performing. Because of this, I made my own. With the absence of an original name, 5mLoading was born.

5mLoading is a feature-rich, customisable, and, most importantly, lightweight loading screen. Some key features being that:
- you can play music from YouTube playlists or SoundCloud while you wait for the game to load,
- you can see the current time locally, as well as how long you've been waiting to load into the server; and:
- server admins can easily customise everyting from the background to the text on the screen.

I got straight to work and released v0.1.0 on GitHub later that week. I made [a post of the official FiveM forums](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-5mloading-yet-another-loading-screen/1459768) that quickly achieved several hundred views, and has now amounted to, as of writing, almost five thousand views.

From July to September, I worked tirelessly on the loading screen. A lot of feedback came from the aforementioned forum, as well as bug reports. It was a crucial tool and was great to talk with those who used my rather simple loading screen to better it. Over time, with patches and more features, v0.5.0 came out in December 2020.

That same month, I decided to deprecate and bring 5mLoading into an end-of-life state due to technical limitations. I switched to Pop!\_OS full-time, and was no longer able to play FiveM.
