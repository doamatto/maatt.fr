This is a library for all of the Google APIs written in Vlang using only modules in vlib[^1]. It's far from finished, but I do hope to get it done sometime in the near future. Vlang is known for being as fast as C and crazy fast and small. It also means that (in theory) I'm making a C wrapper for the Google APIs, as V works with anything with C interop.

Overall, this is both a way to introduce me into and experiment with Vlang before starting to use it in some production instances with things like [Studio9.](/projects/mono)

I started working on this in June 2021 and put progress on hold a few months later as I had more important things to work on. I still want to finish and bring a general API for YouTube at the least, but as for when this will be done is beyond me.

[^1]: vlib is Vlang's standard library of modules. I'm going to try and do it all in vlib (so far, so good), but I can't guarantee it.
