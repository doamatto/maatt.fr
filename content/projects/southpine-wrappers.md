## ⚠️ Heads up!
This page is for a project that doesn't exist anymore or never existed in the first place. The best term for something like this is **vaporware.** In my eyes, however, it's better to keep these pages than to remove them, [creating linkrot.](@/blog/linkrot.md)

While I did some freelance work at [Glitch Entertainment](https://github.com/playglitch), I worked on an API to interact with the player API and allow you to access things such as a player's level or integrate easily into tools like Discord's Rich presence SDK through a seperate client (if you wanted to do that for some reason).

When I left Glitch in October 2020, I gave them both SouthNode (and SouthJS, the browser-compatible version) and SouthPy. Sadly, they haven't been improved any further.
