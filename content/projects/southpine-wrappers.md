## ⚠️ Heads up!
This page is for a project that still has a GitHub repository. For this reason, this page will still start redirecting to its repository after 31 July, 2022. Redirects for this page will cease after 31 December, 2022.

While I did some freelance work at [Glitch Entertainment](https://github.com/playglitch), I worked on an API to interact with the player API and allow you to access things such as a player's level or integrate easily into tools like Discord's Rich presence SDK through a seperate client (if you wanted to do that for some reason).

When I left Glitch in October 2020, I gave them both SouthNode (and SouthJS, the browser-compatible version) and SouthPy. Sadly, they haven't been improved any further.
