In December 2020, I started working on [Mono](/projects/mono) (as of writing, it hasn't been announced what it is yet; so check the project page for it to learn more). I wanted to start a simple initiative to allow an easy distinction that all of the sub-projects are private-by-default. I also wanted to make it easy for others to say: "I want to be a part of this" in turn. So, I've started working on "La campagne «vie privée par défaut»" or "The 'Privacy by Default' campaign."
