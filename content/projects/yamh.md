YAMH, or Yet Another Markdown to HTML converter, is exactly what it sounds like. It benefits from being dirt simple and null-safe. It works in both [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and normal Dart applications, allowing you to input either a string or a file to convert.

## Planned features
- Batch parsing
- Availablitiy on NPM as a native alternative to other solutions
