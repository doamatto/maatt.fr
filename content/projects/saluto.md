## ⚠️ Heads up!
This page is for a project that doesn't exist anymore or never existed in the first place. The best term for something like this is **vaporware.** In my eyes, however, it's better to keep these pages than to remove them, [creating linkrot.](/blog/linkrot)

On the homepage of my site, I've always had written "Bonjour". I've slowly started to learn other languages outside of English and French and wanted to add a mini flair to the site.

It had to follow a strict criteria, however:
- had to be tiny (less than 500 bytes),
- could not rely on it (needs to have HTML to back it up in the event of a slow connection or some other issue),
- had to be fast (had to execute just as fast as it gets loaded on the page).

Saluto pulled off just that by weighing in at a little over 300 bytes, taking only 8 milliseconds on a modern connection and being smaller than most favicons. It works fast and the classic "Bonjour" is always there as a placeholder, should the script break somehow or JavaScript be absent for whatever reason.
