I've wanted to experiment with `discordgo`, a Golang wrapper for Discord's API, for a hot while. I haven't really had a need or want for awhile, but, as I got more and more into Golang recently, I was warming up to the idea of it. A friend of mine reached out to me with woes of a server's moderators not being the most active and wanted to have a way for the community to vote on less aggressive actions like muting users until a moderator can handle the problem.

I did up VTM (Vote to Mute) to allow exactly what is says: a quick way to mute people by vote.
