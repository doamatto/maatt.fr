## ⚠️ Heads up!
This page is for a project that doesn't exist anymore or never existed in the first place. The best term for something like this is **vaporware.** In my eyes, however, it's better to keep these pages than to remove them, [creating linkrot.](@/blog/linkrot.md)

Hydro is a simple Twitch chatbot that serves one purpose, and one alone. To keep you hydrated while live.

Hydro has simple, but powerful per-channel customizations such as:
- changing the time between reminders (currently 15m-1h and vitually everywhere in between); and:
- changing the language of the bot (currently only French and English).

Inspired by the OG itself, [Stay_Hydrated_Bot](https://www.twitch.tv/stay_hydrated_bot), Hydro aims to stay on forever. But, if we do decide to retire, you can still host it yourself on as low-power as a Raspberry Pi 3B+
