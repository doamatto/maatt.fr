Snapdrop is one of my favourite tools I use. But it's a bit of a pain to have to always open up the website just for it. So, I decided to make native clients to mimick the behaviour of AirDrop for Windows, macOS, Gnome, Nautilus, iOS, and Android (in other words, some of the most popular platforms and tools out there).

I have no clue when I'll be done with this, but it should be soon-ish. Windows, Mac, Gnome, and Nautilus are all written in native code (Windows in C#, macOS in Obj-C with support for M1 and Intel, Gnome/Nautilus in whatever language needed), while iOS and Android are done via React Native and written in TypeScript.
