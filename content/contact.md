Some other places around the internet that I'm at are:
- Behance: [@doamatto](https://behance.net/doamatto)
- GitHub: [@doamatto](https://github.com/doamatto)
- Last.fm: [doamatto](https://www.last.fm/user/doamatto)
- MusicBrainz: [/user/doamatto](https://musicbrainz.org/user/doamatto)

Although there are other places I lurk [or used to](@/archive/social.md), I don't want to make the lists longer than they already are. Hope to hear from you soon :)
