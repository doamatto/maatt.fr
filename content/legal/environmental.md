I take utmost care when it comes to making this site, and any other brands I run, as environmentally friendly as possible. This policy outlines the services we use, how they are clean, and what I do to offset emissions, if they are not. I maintain the following policy:
  - services must use green energy, or be reasonably capable of being reputably offset
  - services must handle data ethically and act reasonably ethically, where applicable
  - services must be in a decent territory for both my privacy and, where applicalbe, the privacy of end-users
