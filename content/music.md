## What I Like
I feel like I'm one of the five people who doesn't really have a « taste ». The best way to put it is I like songs from Slipknot while also liking songs from Limbo and mxmtoon. I've been taking time to curate some of my favourites into playlists as of late, so that's the best place to see what suits my fancy. You can see those playlists [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/rr0fpmxz77lzn7vktz1fzg4ai) and convert them with a tool like Soundiiz.

## What I've Made
I experiment with new tools and effects that I find on occasion. I usually put them in one of two places:
- [Soundcloud—](https://soundcloud.com/doamatto) for short bits or little tests; or:
- [Bandcamp](https://doamatto.bandcamp.com) for longer format songs and the works.

I am by no means great at it, but I'd like to think I'm half-decent, and slowly getting better by the day.
