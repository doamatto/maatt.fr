## What I Like
I feel like I'm one of the five people who doesn't really have a « taste ». The best way to put it is I like songs from Slipknot while also liking songs from Limbo and mxmtoon. I've been taking time to curate some of my favourites into playlists as of late, so that's the best place to see what suits my fancy. You can see those playlists [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/rr0fpmxz77lzn7vktz1fzg4ai) and convert them with a tool like Soundiiz.
