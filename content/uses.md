## Software
- **[1Password—](https://1password.com)** I used [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) for ages (still recommend it for those who need a password manager). 1Password is way more polished, however.
- **[Alfred—](https://www.alfredapp.com)** Alfred is essentially Spotlight Search, but on steriods. An essential for anyone on macOS.
- **[Apollo—](https://www.apolloapp.io)** As most everyone will tell you, this is easly the best third-party Reddit app on the App Store.
- **[Bandcamp—](https://bandcamp.com)** Bandcamp is home to a metric crap tonne of music from indie artists to some rather large bands.
- **[Figma—](https://www.figma.com)** Needs little to no introduction in the design space: Figma is one of the greatest design tols that lets you do some crazy stuff with little effort.
- **[foobar2000—](https://foobar2000.org)** Greatest music player on Windows, hands down.
- **[ghostwriter—](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter)** A gorgerous Markdown editor that is easily one of the greatest notepad apps out there
- **[Google Workspace—](https://workspace.google.com)** Not a huge fan of Google, but Workspace checks all the boxes when it comes to being versitile and cheap. It's a nice bonus to have an SLA on Google services, as well as extra data protections because of DPAs.
- **[Gumroad—](https://gumroad.com)** Easily one of the best places for creawtors to sell their products online (be it digital or physical).
- **[Hush—](https://oblador.github.io/hush/)** One of the fastest content blockers for Safari. An essential on my phone.
- **[Miniflux—](https://miniflux.app)** One of my favourite feed readers that is flawless for being used on my laptop or computer.
- **[Namecheap—](https://www.namecheap.com)** Namecheap is easily on of the best domain providers out there. They've got crazy fast support and are privacy-friendly.
- **[NetNewsWire—](https://netnewswire.com)** One of the greatest feed readers out there. Shame it doesn't work with Miniflux.. yet
- **[NextDNS—](https://nextdns.io)** NextDNS is basically a DNS provider where you can control what happens. It's like the private DNS services with Cisco, but aimed at consumers.
- **[Pocket Casts—](https://www.pocketcasts.com)** Easy the greatest podcast client ever. Still hate that they switched to a subscription-model. Still love that they grandfathered me to a lifetime plan.
- **[Prism Music—](https://prism-music.app/)** An essential if you use Plex for music on iOS
- **[Sublime Text—](https://sublimetext.com)** Easily the best code editor out there.
- **[Tailscale—](https://tailscale.com)** Great one-click solution for a WireGuard VPN for connecting to self-hosted things off your network.
- **[Vercel—](https://vercel.com)** This site, as well as a crap ton of my web projects, run on Vercel. It's easily one of my favourite hosting providers and works well with Next.js (considering as they are the people behind it)
