Over the past 6 or so years, I've worked on software and tools that allow me to do my best work, and to help empower others. I feel like I've found myself successful with some of those projects making various sized impacts.

I've never been good at receiving (or giving, for that matter) gifts, but I understand that some people like showing support. So, I've setup two ways you could do so:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/doamatto/)
- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/doamatto/)

Thank you for your support and here's to more great things in the future!
