In 2019, I hosted a podcast with my mate Charlie where we would look at tech we use everyday and talk about where it falls flat. We mixed in deliriously-fuelled comedy. Looking back, it's amazing how young both of us sounded, not to mention how it wasn't the smartest idea. I might bring it back up and do a second season with the show adjusted to be overall better (essentially more critical, constructive, et al).

In 2021, [we decided to start a new podcast.](/podcasts)
