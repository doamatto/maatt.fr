I used to host a podcast with [Charlie](https://epic4809.github.io), where we find tech to bash that people use everyday. Every week (or so), you could end up either learning a thing or two about tech or laughing at deliriously-fuelled comedy.

We stopped after awhile because it wasn't the greatest content.
