## Software
- **[1Password—](https://1password.com)** I used [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) for ages (still recommend it for those who need a *free* password manager). 1Password is far more polished.
- **[Apollo—](https://www.apolloapp.io)** As most everyone will tell you, this is the best third-party Reddit app on the App Store.
- **[Bandcamp—](https://bandcamp.com)** Home to a metric crap tonne of music from indie artists to some rather large bands.
- **[Fastmail—](https://fastmail.com)** Used Tutanota and Protonmail, but both are far too limited to be remotely recommendable. FM is a good middle ground for privacy respecting while still having the features I find essential: IMAP, full Sieve support, et al.
- **[foobar2000—](https://foobar2000.org)** Greatest music player on Windows, hands down.
- **[Mullvad—](https://mullvad.net)** One of the best VPNs I've used. Well worth the 5€ a month.
- **[Namecheap—](https://www.namecheap.com)** Crazy fast support and privacy-friendly.
- **[NetNewsWire—](https://netnewswire.com)** One of the best feed reader for iOS and macOS.
- **[Pocket Casts—](https://www.pocketcasts.com)** Simply the greatest podcast client. Ever.
- **[Tailscale—](https://tailscale.com)** Great one-click solution for a WireGuard VPN for connecting to self-hosted things off your network.
