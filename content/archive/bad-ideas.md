- A binary which stores encrypted secrets then after decrypt loads into env vars for you (stolen from Daniel)
    - It's not smart nor really practical to do this. The only safeâ„¢ way to do this would be with a databse like Postgres, but that would bloat things and be far too overkill
- Online dashboard
    - This is honestly just one of those things that isn't needed by anyone but maybe a hedge-fund analyst to know their stocks. As cool as it might be or see to have all this data aggregated for your viewing pleasure, there's really no gain to it. Make stuff you like to make, whether people give you likes or not (unless it's illegal and/or immoral).
- Daily my RPi
    - I have no reason not to this other than the fact that school is in session and I'm on payroll now, meaning I don't really have the time to deal with the finikiness or any other quirks that might come from either a Raspberry Pi, its power supply, its microSD card, Linux, or some other variable I'm not aware of. Running Windows 10 E-Channel in the meantime
- Anki client that's a bit prettier than the original
    - I realise now that the Anki client is fine how it is. Decks are now working fine on Windows, but still wonky on my laptop (Debian-based). The only thing that I might want to make a client for is iOS, but I still plan to buy the client if I go down that route. 
- Voting info ~~app~~ website, gun approval workflow, et al. politics
    - If I have one take away living in the U.S., it's to not get remotely attached to politics. 
- Alternative to Steam Overlay
    - I don't really play games as much anymore and, when I do, I don't really use overlays bar for the time. I wear a watch, have a phone, and could buy a dedicated clock; if I really wanted to know the time, there are other means
- NPM but made right
    - I think NPM is terrible, but Deno arguably has it worst. I should think up some way to make packaging sane there, if possible
- xBrowserSync related clients and servers
    - The way data is formatted is flawed in a sense; I think I can improve it myself and will make my own alternative (at some point).
- WebExtensions in WASM
- Utility CSS framework engine
    - I've grown to dislike Tailwind and others as it just moves the bloat of styling to other areas such as the markup. Easier? Yes. As hackable, per say? No.
- Custom newspaper delivery service
    - Although I use RSS/Atom, I can't see this being something sane for people to use. It's better to curate your own feeds with what you need, not subscribe to hundreds you never read. It would be just as bad as social media at that point
- Static site hosting that doesn't suck
    - I switched from Vercel to AWS Amplify which is not that bad. I think there's still some room for improvement in the documentation category, but it's generally a far better and more reliable experience so far compared to Vercel and Netlify. I might revive this idea though
- Make my own RPi/Arduino
    - Although I'm currently working on hardware, this seems like a slight waste of time and resources for me on a hobby project. I'd rather do other hobby projects that would genuiunely be useful to me and that I'd want to use day-in and day-out
- An iOS mail app that doesn't suck
    - I don't really check my email on my phone anymore. I might even uninstall the Fastmail app altogether and just leave the calendar and contacts synced.
- Yet another Linktree/et al. alternative
- An OAUTH layer that goes zoom
    - If you can't do sane OAUTH yourself, you should really learn to. I don't want to make things people rely on because their lazy. I want to make things people rely on because it makes what they build that much better.
- Auto updater for Choco/Scoop package sources
- Simple new tab dashboard
    - It's not that necessary to have. I think I'd only glance once or twice. I'm only on a new tab for as long as it takes to complete a search or type in a website
- Foobar2000 & GNOME Music extensions for Plex
- Mint but good
- Health record logging app
    - I think this would have been more work than it's worth to get setup, unfortunately
- FOSS DMV test prep app
    - This is honestly a great idea, but I can't see myself maintaining this app outside of once I would get a license; it just doesn't make sense to me
- FOSS alternative to Google Forms
    - I don't really use Google Forms. It would be cool to still have this, and it's definetely an idea I'll consider bringing back, but for now it seems extraneous
- Make an alternative to GULP and ESLint
- An inventory SaaS
    - Just use a CSV file and you'll be generally grand 
- XBPS but for Windows
    - It's possible, but just not pracitcal in terms of building it up
