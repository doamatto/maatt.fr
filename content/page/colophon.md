This site is hosted on a server in Iceland from [1984 Hosting](https://1984.is) using Caddy. It's built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), formerly [Zola](https://www.getzola.org). I use [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com) when working on it and Hemingway Writer for writing.

This site was designed to work with screen readers and follow RGAA standards and guidelines. Both of these aid me personally. It only made sense to be strict requirements for this site.
