Salut! My name's Matt Ronchetto (I go by `ドアマット` or `doamatto` on the Internet) and **I'm a community college student with plans to transfer and study computer engineering.** Outside of school, **I run [The Farer Group](https://farer.group) with Daniel and develop open-source software, with an emphasis on accessibility and ethics.**<br/>
[See what I've been working on &rarr;](/work)

I currently study at San Diego Miramar College, working on my associate for transfer. **I plan to transfer to UC San Diego or a university in the ETH Domain.** I'm a part of [the local Phi Theta Kappa chapter](https://ptk.org) and plan to join other clubs in the near future.<br/>
<!--[See my CV &rarr;](@/cv)-->

I've messed around with software and programming <abbr title="about 7 years">since 2015</abbr> or so; starting off with Python and Ruby on Rails. Since then, I've focused my work into Golang. I plan to dig deeper into Swift, Objective-C, and MATLAB in the near-ish future. Anything I develop that's public is likely on [GitHub.](https://github.com/doamatto)

Outside of my programming, I've enjoyed watching Formula One races and playing story-rich games with phenomenal soundtracks; some of my favourites being the Life is Strange and Portal series, Necrobarista, Coffee Talk, and VA-11 HALL-A. I spend my free time listening to music of just about every genre and [drawing people and scenery.](/art)<br/>
