**I'm a community college student with plans to transfer and study computer engineering.** Outside of school, **I run [The Farer Group](https://farer.group)** with [Daniel](https://daniel.cafe) and **develop open-source software, with an emphasis on accessibility and ethics.**<br/>

I currently study at San Diego Miramar College, working on my associate for transfer. **I plan to transfer to UC San Diego or a university in the ETH Domain and graduate with a M.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Signal & Image Processing.** I'm a part of [the Phi Theta Kappa chapter](https://sites.google.com/view/miramarptk) and [Club Spectrum club](https://sites.google.com/view/club-spectrum/) at San Diego Miramar.<br/>

I've messed around with software and programming <abbr title="about 8 years">since 2015</abbr> or so; starting off with Python and Ruby on Rails. Since, I've focused my work into Golang. I plan to dig deeper into Swift and Objective-C in the future. Anything I develop that's public is likely on [GitHub.](https://github.com/doamatto)

Outside of programming, I enjoy watching Formula One races and playing story-rich games with phenomenal soundtracks; some of my favourites being the Portal series, Necrobarista, Coffee Talk, and VA-11 HALL-A. I spend my free time listening to music of just about every genre and [drawing people and scenery.](/art)<br/>
