I've messed around with software and programming <abbr title="about 8 years">since 2015</abbr> or so; starting off with Python and Ruby on Rails. Since, I've focused my work into Golang and Node. I plan to dig deeper into Rust and Objective-C in the future. Anything I develop that's public is likely on [GitHub.](https://github.com/doamatto)

Outside of programming, I enjoy watching Formula One races and playing story-rich games with phenomenal soundtracks; some of my favourites being the Portal series, Necrobarista, Coffee Talk, and VA-11 HALL-A. I spend my free time listening to music of just about every genre and [drawing people and scenery.](/art/)<br/>
