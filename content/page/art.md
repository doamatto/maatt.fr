I spend a fair amount of my free time enjoying "the finer things" like drawing people and scenery, as well as taking pictures and video.

## Cinematography
In 2022, I decided to start back up with creating cinematography. Once every 2 weeks-ish, I bring a video that I worked on to YouTube under the `doamatto` brand. As of writing, the first video hasn't even started scripting.

## Digital and traditional art
I keep my portfolio with [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/doa-matt-o) under the close-enough-psuedonym of `doa-matt-o`. It contains some works that I make from time-to-time, as well as a good chunk of my sketchbook.

I'm currently in the process of mirroring my sketchbook to upload straight here and be pushed to DeviantArt's Journaling functionality (I forget the exact name; I haven't touched the site in awhile and am still getting used to it all again haha).

## Photography
I used to store my photos with Flickr, Unsplash (until they said my pictures were "too blurry" because some had a shallow DOF), then Behance. I'm (very slowly) working on a small gallery generator, but I do want to still find some decent platform to share my works.

In probably *hilarious* news, I tried signing up with my `maatt` domain and, much to my surprise, can't. Seems both with `heyy+flickr` and just `heyy` get rejected. Might be a bug, might be a feature; who knows. What a shame.
