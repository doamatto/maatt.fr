### FAQ

**Q:** When will you be live?<br>
**A:** Look at the schedules above.

**Q:** Why do you stream on multiple platforms?<br>
**A:** Because of the nature of social platforms like Twitch and YouTube, most people prefer a channel that does one thing, not many. For that reason, I have several places where I stream for different things. It's less confusing that is sounds, I swear.

**Q:** What if I missed a stream?<br>
**A:** Twitch streams are sometimes made into YouTube compilations. Instagram streams are available for replay up to 24 hours before going poof for the unforeseeable future.
