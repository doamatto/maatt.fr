I spend a fair amount of my free time enjoying "the finer things" like drawing people and scenery, as well as taking pictures and video.

## Digital and traditional art
I keep my portfolio with [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/doa-matt-o) under the close-enough-psuedonym of `doa-matt-o`. It contains some works that I make from time-to-time, as well as a good chunk of my sketchbook.

You can view a mirror [here.](/sketchbook)

## Photography
I used to store my photos with Flickr, Unsplash (until they said my pictures were "too blurry" because some had a shallow DOF), then Behance. 

I now store whatever photos I want [here.](/photobook)
