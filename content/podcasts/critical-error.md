In July, [Charlie](https://epic4809.github.io) and I decided to spin back-up [Bashin](/archive/bashin) under a new name: Critical Error.

Every other week, we meet up to talk about some of the latest things in tech and analyse the good, the bad, and the ugly. We do our best to be as critical as possible 

You can listen to Critical Error on:
