## Software
- Music search by location– favours Bandcamp, then Spotify/Qobuz
- Sim racing/trucking telemetry
- An OSM app that doesn't suck
    - Updates database weekly, manual bypass
    - Support for editing OSM
    - Same gorgeous modeling for monuments as Apple has
- Private kaomoji client for iOS— I don't need trackers for Japanese emoticons
- A free golden hour timer
- Last.fm alternative
- Convert SVG to Tricaster XML

## Hardware
- Prusa-esque 2D printer
  - FOSS firmware, software, drivers, et al.
  - Open blueprints so you could print it or buy a DIY kit
