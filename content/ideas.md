Although I don't mind if you do one of these before me, it's very likely I'll do all of these things myself. I'm an overachiever like that :P

- An inventory SaaS
  - Needs to have a simple API that can be easily interacted with securely
  - Ready for beginners in their homes, powerful enough for enterprise usage
