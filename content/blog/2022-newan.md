This Christmas, I was treated to a game I had been anticipating ever since the teasers in March 2021. I loved the first Life is Strange game, as well as the prequel: Before the Storm. The soundtrack and the story-line was captivating and nothing short of stunning. Nor was every emotion conveyed in the characters: be it the good and the bad, the hilarious and the depressing. When I saw its "sequel," Life is Strange 2, I decided to gloss over the title. Yet, when the trailers for True Colors came, I was ecstatic. It may have been in part to my love for mxmtoon's music from Bandcamp in 2017 that would be featured in it, maybe just the general love to see a generally cool power: psychic empathy.

Whatever it was, it was enough to have on my Christmas list and I ended up picking it up come the holidays. The only regret I have playing the game? How much it reminded me of the titles it now lives in the the trophy shelf in my head for "Best Games I've Ever Had The Honor of Enjoying." The soundtrack was nothing short of amazing and got me back into bands I hadn't listened to for way too long. The deep connections with every character, even the short-lived connection with her brother. Which is not a spoiler as he dies in the trailer. Which I forgot about. Which is not the point. This game did everything just right. And it f\*cked with my head after.

A long story short, this game took me from what I had kind of planned for life, or at least what I thought I could do for life. Now, I'm even more clueless, which is hilarious as I'm supposed to start to figure that out as I start to wrap up secondary. An Eng. of some smell? Film? Arts of some taste? Who even knows now. All I know is that Alex's flat that she basically inherited is a layout I somehow never knew existed but always wanted.

Regardless, enjoy 2022 as much as you can. Or at least not try to ruin for others. Here's to another year of me sh\*tposting into the void that is this blog.
