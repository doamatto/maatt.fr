It seems silly, but buying a domain is something that takes a little *too* much effort. Most people just look to see if a `.com` is available and call it a day. When I got my first `.me` as part of GitHub's free student developer pack, I knew that it was different in technicality. There's the obvious: it's a `.me`, it's not a `.com`. But then when it comes to SEO or the trust of an individual, a .com or a .me may gain a certain favour over the other.

## So, how do you eradicate the trust?
Simple: use a niche TLD or a TLD attached to something irreputible. For many, a `.xyz` will suffice. It's cheap and is often used in phising attempts. However, as seen with sites as [my own](https://doamatto.xyz) and others like [telepathics](https://telepathics.xyz), legitimate people still have legitimate websites on these domains. The trust is low because the majority is.. well, garbage.

Many grade school teachers will tell you that a `.COM` or a `.NET` are irreputible and filled with lies, but that `.ORG`s are the holy grail of accurate information. And while I won't say that any of these domains aren't filled with bad actors, there are some notable sites in all 3 that are good:
  - Britannica.**COM**
  - Wikipedia.**ORG**
  - LaPoste.**NET**

Some biases are made outside of the general convention though. In the way of `.cn` and `.hk`, for instance, there's a large disposition against the domains and services coming out of that region in [the United States](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-withdrawing-trump-executive-orders-that-sought-ban-tiktok-wechat-2021-06-09/) for :sparkles: reasons :sparkles:. As someone who doesn't want to be banned from Weixin or other platforms, I'll naturally hold my tongue.

## So, how do you reach maximum trust?
In two methods, one that's possible, but kinda dumb, and one that's not possible for the average person. Starting with the impossible, you use one of the following TLDs:
  - .GOV
  - .EDU
  - .MIL
  - .EUROPA.EU
  - just about any other government TLD (like GOUV.fr)

These domains are restricted for certain groups and individuals, the first three being exclusive to the United States Government and its educational and defence departments. With .GOV and .EDU, you could argue that they shouldn't be restricted to the U.S. because there are other governments and other <abbr title="Western Association of Schools and Colleges; accredits all types of schools so that degrees can be granted. Internationally seen in east asia, amongst other areas.">WASC</abbr> accreditted schools internationally. Others are harder to argue like .MIL, as the .MIL (U.S. Military) were the founding fathers of the Internet with ARPANET and its sibling projects.

However, for those who are normal and can't use these domains, a maximum level trust is able to earned with what's often dubbed "Extended Validation" or "EV" TLS certificate and a <abbr title="WHO IS the owner of that site.">WHOIS</abbr>-lacking domain. Domains like `.US` require their owners to disclose their real name, their real address or P.O. box, their real phone number, et al. EV certificates follow a similar principal and allow browsers to sometimes display the company's name before the URL to show that the site is in fact owned by that company.

Naturally, when your data is on the Internet for all those to see, there are some privacy issues. Stalkers are able to see a lot of new information on an individual and gain access to troves. In fact, even this site's domain (`maatt.fr`) has some personal information seeping through [in the form of P.O. boxes.](https://www.afnic.fr/noms-de-domaine/tout-savoir/whois-trouver-un-nom-de-domaine/?domaine=maatt+&tld=fr) Although, `.FR` doesn't require you to disclose information, some providers don't provide what's known as WHOIS Privacy or an aliasing service to redact your information while remaining compliant with regulations from ICANN and IANA.

Adding onto a `.FR` domain, amongst others, can only be registered to people in certian places or to aliases located in certain places. `.EU` and `.FR` are exclusive to those who have addresses pointing in their WHOIS data to countries in the EU, amongst a select few others.

## Okay, what do I do that's reputable but actually possible ~~without selling my soul to the devil~~?
The answer is simple: register whatever the hell you want. A .com works fine. Daniel uses a `.WS` (for some reason). I use `.CH` and `.FR` (`.XYZ` and `.CN`, too). Yes, your TLD will matter at a glance. A `.ORG` may look more reputable than a `.XYZ`. A `.EU` with its region restrictions for registration may look better than a `.SITE`.

However, once someone decides to go to your site or clicks a link from a friend, it depends entirely on your site's contents for your reputability. First impressions are important, but so are the contents of your articles, the biases in them, the facts and lies in them, et al., et al.
