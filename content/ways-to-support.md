Like the things I do or want to support my projects? Here's how you can help.

## Send good vibes
The best you can do is show your appreciation
- [reach out to me](@/contact.md) for anything, even if it's simply to say thanks for something I've done or send me a song recommendation
- share things that I've made or been a part of with others
- contribute in FOSS projects of mine

## Donations
Don't feel pressured to donate anything, but I appreciate every penny I receive; it helps further emphasise the reach and impact of the things I make.

I accept donations via [Liberapay.](https://liberapay.com/doamatto/)
