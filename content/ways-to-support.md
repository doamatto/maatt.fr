Like the things I do or want to support my projects? Here's how you can help.

## Send good vibes
The best you can do is show your appreciation
- reach out to me for anything, even if it's simply to say thanks for something I've done or send me a song recommendation
- share things that I've made or been a part of with others
- contribute to FOSS projects of mine
