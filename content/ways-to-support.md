Like the things I do or want to support my projects? Here's how you can help.

## Send good vibes
The best you can do is show your appreciation
- [reach out to me](@/contact.md) for anything, even if it's simply to say thanks for something I've done or send me a song recommendation
- share things that I've made or been a part of with others
- contribute in FOSS projects of mine

## Support those who need it first

Every two quarters, I choose a charity to match up to 100 US$ to. These are commonly tax write-offs in the U.S. and help put money in the pockets of those who deserve it the most.

From **1 june, 2022 to 31 december, 2022**, we're raising money for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. [Donate on their website](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/join-give/ways-to-give/give) and send your receipt to `foragoodcause [at] maatt.ch`

Basically everything from this point on are very generous ways to help support my projects or support me.

## Donations
Don't feel pressured to donate anything, but I appreciate every penny I receive; it helps further emphasise the reach and impact of the things I make.

I accept donations via [Liberapay.](https://liberapay.com/doamatto/)

## Wishlists and gifts
- [Amtrak gift card—](https://www.amtrak.com/planning-booking/tickets-reservations/giftcards.html) Fund my occasional travel in the U.S. to take a break and enjoy some cool things ([I like trains](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-like-trains)).
- [Apple gift card—](https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/gift-cards/itunes-electronic) I use the French app store and gift cards are apparently not transferrable between app stores (which is pretty stupid).
- [Bandcamp gift card–](https://bandcamp.com/gift_cards) fuel my CD collection
- [GOG games–](https://www.gog.com/en/u/doamatto/wishlist) games are fun, next question.
- [Marriott gift card—](https://gifts.marriott.com) Same with Amtrak; fund my occasional travel in the U.S.
- [MIT Technology Review—](https://subscriptions.technologyreview.com/loading.do?omedasite=MITTR_GIFT&ver=dp) interesting articles, put simply
- [Monterey Bay Aquarium—](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/join-give/become-a-member/give) not only does it go to a great cause, but I also get to enjoy a great bi-yearly magazine from them. [Go Rosa!](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/visit/exhibits/sea-otters/meet-our-otters)
