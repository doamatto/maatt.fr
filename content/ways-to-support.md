Like the things I do or want to support my projects? Here's how you can help.

## Send good vibes
The best you can do is show your appreciation
- [reach out to me](@/contact.md) for anything, even if it's simply to say thanks for something I've done
- share things that I've made or been a part of with others

---

Basically everything from this point on are very generous ways to help support my projects.

## Donations
Don't feel pressured to donate anything, but I appreciate every penny I receive; it helps further emphasise the reach and impact of the things I make.

I accept donations via [Liberapay.](https://liberapay.com/doamatto/)

## Referral links
- [Fastmail–](https://ref.fm/u27226768) the best alternative to Gmail
- [Mega–](https://mega.nz/aff=LYzEWOoubqI) decently private cloud storage

## Wishlists
- [Bandcamp gift card–](https://bandcamp.com/gift_cards) fuel my CD collection
- [Libro.fm gift card–](https://libro.fm/gift)
