Like the things I do or want to support my projects? Here's how you can help.

## Send good vibes
The best you can do is show your appreciation
- [reach out to me](@/contact.md) for anything, even if it's simply to say thanks for something I've done
- share things that I've made or been a part of with others

---

Basically everything from this point on are very generous ways to help support my projects or support me.

## Donations
Don't feel pressured to donate anything, but I appreciate every penny I receive; it helps further emphasise the reach and impact of the things I make.

I accept donations via [Liberapay.](https://liberapay.com/doamatto/)

## Referral links
- [Fastmail–](https://ref.fm/u27226768) the best alternative to Gmail
- [Mega–](https://mega.nz/aff=LYzEWOoubqI) decently private cloud storage

## Wishlists and gifts
- [Apple gift card—](https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/gift-cards/itunes-electronic) I use the French app store and gift cards are apparently not transferrable between app stores. 
- [Bandcamp gift card–](https://bandcamp.com/gift_cards) fuel my CD collection
- [GOG games–](https://www.gog.com/en/u/doamatto/wishlist) games are fun; next question.
- [Monterey Bay Aquarium—](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/join-give/become-a-member/give) not only does it go to a great cause, but I also get to enjoy a great bi-yearly magazine from them. [Go Rosa!](https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/visit/exhibits/sea-otters/meet-our-otters)
