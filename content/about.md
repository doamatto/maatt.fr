## Salut!

My name’s **Matt Ronchetto** (I go by `ドアマット` or `doamatto` on the Internet) and **I’m a high schooler living in San Diego.** I enjoy engineering, be it computer or otherwise, photography, and videography.

I currently **work part-time at [Chili’s](https://chilis.com)** as a host and **as the solutions architect and web development manager [at Inkjar.](https://inkjar.org)**<br/>
[See my full work history and CV on Linkedin &rarr;](https://linkedin.com/in/matthewronchetto)

In my spare time, **I experiment with different programming languages and libraries**, as well as love shooting pictures and videos to edit together. I spend a lot of time listening to music with some of my favourite songs coming from artists like BIBI, spill tab, and yaeji.<br/>

I’m an avid audiophile and general tech know-it-all. I'm an activist for digital rights and accessibility standards like WCAG, as well as general data privacy and security. **I want to take a deep dive into PCB design and further my knowledge of network management and the inner workings of the Linux kernel.**<br/>

**I'm a peer tutor at my high school,** specialising in English and History, with plans to expand into 9th and 10th grade math. **I also help run the audio and visual works for assemblies and other school events,** as well as document it for the school's internal news network.

Outside of technology, I enjoy reading books and watching animated series. Some of my favourites are *1984* by George Orwell and *Soul Eater*. I love puzzle and story-rich games; some of my favourites being Necrobarista, VA-11 HALL-A, Superliminal, and the Portal series. I enjoy learning new things and am currently learning my third language (Japanese; my first two were French and English).

### Nerd facts

This website was designed to be simple, yet nice looking. It’s preprocessed by Zola and hosted on AWS Amplify. It’s distributed globally by Cloudflare, which I may (or may not) regret. I use [my own Docker image](https://github.com/doamatto/amplify-zola) for AWS to try and keep things as light as possible, while staying as fast as possible. It also allows me to be able to use Zola in the first place, as Zola isn't on the NPM, nor is it pre-installed or easily installable on AWS' default container.

I designed this site with screen readers and text-based browsers in mind. As a user of a screen reader, I wanted to make sure that, if I wanted to use my screen without my glasses, I could. I also made sure to use WCAG AA or greater colour contrast, as well as used common practices with images and document formatting to ensure the best experience for those who use alternative interface methods from a mouse or keyboard, like a joystick.

### Programming

I’ve messed around with software and programming for about the past 7 years or so now. I’ve dabbled in tons of languages but always come back to Golang and JavaScript. I'm currently learning C and Assembly, and I plan to learn Swift. Anything I make that’s public is likely on [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~doamatto/) or [GitHub.](https://github.com/doamatto)
