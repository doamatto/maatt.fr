## Salut!

My name's **Matt Ronchetto** (I go by `ドアマット` or `doamatto`) and **I'm a high schooler living in San Diego**, CA. I enjoy engineering, be it computer or otherwise, and photography.

I currently **work part-time at [Chili's](https://chilis.com)** as a host and **work as the web administrator and web branch manager [at Inkjar.](https://inkjar.org)**

In my spare time, **I experiment with different programming languages and libraries**, as well as love shooting pictures and videos to edit together. I spend a lot of time listening to music, as well, with some of my favourite songs coming from artists like Joji, Bibi, and Yaeji.<br/>
[See what I've been working on &rarr;](/projects)

I'm an avid audiophile and general tech know-it-all. I'm an activist for digital accessibility and rights, such as WCAG colours, data privacy and security, and screen reader friendliness. **I want to take a deep dive into PCB design as well as further my knowledge into network management and the inner workings on the Linux kernel.**

### Nerd facts

This website was designed to be simple, yet nice looking. It's preprocessed by Zola and hosted on Vercel. It's distrubted globally by Cloudflare, which I may (or may not) regret.

This site was designed with screen readers and text-based browsers in mind. As a user of a screen reader, I wanted to make sure that, if for some reason I wanted to use my screen without my glasses, I could.

### Programming

I've messed around with software and programming for about the past 7 years or so now. I've dabbled in tonnes of languages but always find myself coming back to Golang and JavaScript. I plan to learn Haskell and C in the near future, as well as Assembly. Anything I make that's public is likely on [GitHub](https://github.com/doamatto) or [Sourcehut.](https://sr.ht/~doamatto/)
