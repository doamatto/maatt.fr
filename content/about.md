Salut, I'm Matt. I'm a high school student in San Diego, CA that enjoys programming, [writing,](/blog) and way too many other things to count. I'm currently working on:
- developing a better office suite with my friend [Daniel](https://cyckl.net),
- creating software that's out of this world and being the French counterpart to [Lunar Design](https://github.com/designbylunar) with [Jack](https://jackmerrill.com),
- crafting health software for the masses free of charge with SPV (Santé Pour Vous); and:
- empowering the creators of today and tomorrow with [Studio9](https://www.studioneuf.net).

## My interests
I love music.. maybe a little too much. Some of my favourite albums as of late are:
- [Wake Up Sunshine— All Time Low ](https://open.spotify.com/album/1kwAv74rVTTGMpawGsXtiE)
- [Blood Brothers— Blind Channel](https://open.spotify.com/album/16e3tlAEVnBA8ACnnOX3Xv)
- [Phobia— Breaking Benjamin](https://open.spotify.com/album/6yJdQMlMkfYJFiSsL6764c)
- [Teatro d'ira— Måneskin](https://open.spotify.com/album/7KF1Ain9mYYlg5M46g0i4A)
- [Barbara Pravi— Barbara Pravi](https://open.spotify.com/album/3oVZdOn92BZXBqWGezbJtf).

I want to spend a lot of my time after uni and on work breaks to travel the world a lot. I also started to [keep track of the ideas I come up with.](/ideas)

I'm an avid motoring enthusiast and, since I can't do it for real, love to play sim racers like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, amongst other titles. I've been pretty big into Formula racing for a long time (McLaren all the way :smile:)

## Programming
I've been messing around with software and programming for the past 6 years or so now. I program in whatever really suits my fancy at the time, but I'm using a lot of Rust, Dart, and V/Golang, as of late. Anything I make that's public is likely on [GitHub](https://github.com/doamatto).
