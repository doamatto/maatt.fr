Salut, I'm Matt. I'm a high school student in San Diego, CA that enjoys programming, [writing,](/blog) and way too many other things to count. I'm currently working on:
- developing a better office suite with my friend [Daniel](https://cyckl.net),
- leading web design and development at [Inkjar](https://inkjar.github.io) (link is dead currently),
- being a host at Chili's so I can somewhat afford student loans; and:
- creating software that's out of this world and being the French counterpart to [Lunar Design](https://github.com/designbylunar) with [Jack](https://jackmerrill.com).

## My interests
I love music.. maybe a little too much. Some of my favourite albums as of late are:
- [It Is What It Is— Thundercat](https://thundercat.bandcamp.com/album/it-is-what-it-is),
- [C-GIRL— City Girl](https://city-girl.bandcamp.com/album/c-girl),
- [dawn— mxmtoon](https://mxmtoon.bandcamp.com/album/dawn),
- [Tunnel Vision— Castlefield](https://castlefield.bandcamp.com/album/tunnel-vision-2); and:
- [Moe Moe— Moe Shop](https://moeshop.bandcamp.com/album/moe-moe).

I want to spend a lot of my time after uni and on work breaks to travel the world a lot. I also started to [keep track of the ideas I come up with.](/ideas)

I'm an avid motoring enthusiast and, since I can't do it for real, love to play sim racers like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, amongst other titles. I've been pretty big into Formula racing for a long time (McLaren all the way :smile:)

## Programming
I've been messing around with software and programming for the past 6 years or so now. I program in whatever really suits my fancy at the time, but I'm using a lot of Rust, Dart, and V/Golang, as of late. Anything I make that's public is likely on [GitHub](https://github.com/doamatto).
