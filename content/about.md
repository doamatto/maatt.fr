Hi, I'm Matt: community college student, open-source developer, artist, among other things.

I'm an incoming freshman at \[insert university here\] (fingers crossed that this will say [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu)). I run [The Farer Group](https://farer.group) and develop open-source software with an emphasis on accessibility.

When I'm not programming or studying, I'm [doodling](/sketchbook) or [taking pictures](/photobook), watching Formula One, or [writing my latest shitpost.](/blog)

## TL;DR about Me
I'm from San Diego, USA and have spent birth to present down here. Unlike the locals, I'm fine with the heat. Since I was a youngin, I've seen technology evolve: from dial-up Internet to the "fast Internet" I have now, from my Moto flipphone to smartphones; it's given me the privilege to be able to say "Back in my day" and it still be honest.

I started programming in 2015-ish and have had a blast. I knew pretty early on that this was an avenue that I wanted to go down in the future. I've applied to UC San Diego as my first pick for computer engineering, with the fallback being the SDCCD to transfer to UC San Diego or to EPFL to obtain a masters.

## Programming
I've messed around with programming for the past 8 years or so. Python and Ruby were languages that I picked up pretty quickly and fueled my passion to dig deeper. I've since narrowed focus into Golang and Node.js, with hopes to learn Rust and Objective-C in the future. Anything I develop that's public is likely on [GitHub](https://github.com/doamatto) or [Farer's Git server.](https://git.farer.group)

## Photography and art
I've always enjoyed doodling, but in 2021 I decided to take a deep dive into refining the craft and having fun with it more often. I usually use Staedtler set or my rOtring mechanical pencil for sketches, and LOVE using POSCA and Sakura pens. Photography has taken a backseat approach comparitively. Anything I draw that's public is on [DeviantArt](https://deviantart.com/doa-matt-o) or [my sketchbook](/sketchbook), with my photos being in [my photobook.](/photobook)
