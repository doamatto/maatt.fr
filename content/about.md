# Salut! &#x1F44B;

My name's Matt Ronchetto (I go by `ドアマット` or `doamatto` on the Internet) and **I'm a high school student with plans to study computer engineering.** Outside of school, **I run [The Farer Group](https://farer.group) with Daniel and develop and design open-source software, with an emphasis on ethical development and accessibility.**<br/>
[See what I've been working on &rarr;](@/work.md)

I spend my free time listening to music of just about every genre and [drawing people and scenery.](@/art.md) **I participate in a handful of clubs and programs** like SRHS' peer tutoring program, [Inkjar](https://inkjar.org), and [SRHS' Hack Club chapter.](#) **I plan to attend a school either in the Pacific/Mountain region of the U.S., abroad as an Erasmus student** in Ireland or France, **or in the ETH Domain.**<br/>
[See what I'm listening to &rarr;](https://www.last.fm/user/doamatto) and [see my plans for the world &rarr;](@/bucket.md)

<!--**I produce my high school's internal news network, as well as the AV works for assemblies** and other school events. In 2022, I was technical director of SRHS' graduation livestream.<br/>-->
<!-- [See my CV](@/cv.md) -->

Outside of my hobbies, I've enjoyed watching Formula One races and playing story-rich games with phenomenal soundtracks; some of my favourites being the Life is Strange and Portal series, Necrobarista, Coffee Talk, and VA-11 HALL-A.

### Programming
I've messed around with software and programming <abbr title="about 7 years">since 2015</abbr> or so; starting off with Python and Ruby on Rails. Since then, I've focused my work into Golang and Dart. I plan to dig deeper into Swift, Objective-C, and MATLAB in the near-ish future. Anything I develop that's public is likely on [GitHub.](https://github.com/doamatto)

### This website
This site was designed to work with screen readers and follow RGAA standards and guidelines. Both of these aid me personally, and only made sense to be strict requirements for this site. I use the [Zola site generator](https://www.getzola.org/) to build this site and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) to serve its contents.
