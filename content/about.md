**Hello and bienvenue! My name is Matt Ronchetto.** I'm a high school student in sunny San Diego, CA, that expresses myself through too many medians to count. I'm best known for my software and design work, thought. Over time, I've picked up hobbies and niches that I enjoy and constantly do (which may explain my lack of freetime during the week haha). You can see what software and tools, as well as hardware, I use on a day-to-day basis [here.](/uses) I also get a lot of ideas that I [note here.](/ideas) If you can't tell, this page isn't ready for production yet because of how much needs to be re-written and sorted.

## My interests
### Music
I love music.. almost too much. I've dived head first into being an avid audiophile, and don't plan on looking back. I enjoy making the occasional song or beat still. Most anything I publish is only on Soundcloud or Bandcamp. Here are some of my favourite albums as of late:
- [Wake Up Sunsine— All Time Low](https://open.spotify.com/album/1kwAv74rVTTGMpawGsXtiE)
- [Blood Brothers— Blind Channel](https://open.spotify.com/album/16e3tlAEVnBA8ACnnOX3Xv)
- [Phobia— Breaking Benjamin](https://open.spotify.com/album/6yJdQMlMkfYJFiSsL6764c)
- [Teatro d'ira— Måneskin](https://open.spotify.com/album/7KF1Ain9mYYlg5M46g0i4A)
- [Barbara Pravi— Barbara Pravi](https://open.spotify.com/album/3oVZdOn92BZXBqWGezbJtf)

I have a larger page for music [here](/music).

### Sports
I've never been huge into anything sports-wqise. However, I've taken a liking to Formula racing for a long time, as well as footbal. McLaren all the way :)

I enjoy playing sim racers like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars, amongst other titles.

### Animation and food
I like eating food and watching animations, so it's only natural they go hand-in-hand. I watch mostly animations from Japan, but I've also dabled in other areas a good amount. I have a list of some of my favourite shows, foods, and entertainment outside of where I currently live (the US) [here.](/intl)

### Programming
I've been messing around with software and programming for the past 6 years or so now. I program in whatever really suits my fancy at the time, but I'm using a lot of Rust, Dart, and V/Golang, as of late. Anything I make that's public is likely on [GitHub](https://github.com/doamatto).

### Art and graphic design
I'm not the greatest, but I take a good amount of pride in my design "tastes" and have slowly worked towards.
