## December

## November
- **[Created a sticker ripper](https://git.sr.ht/~doamatto/sticker-me)**
- **Started moving to Sourcehut—** As cool as GitHub is, I really just needed to use something different that's faster and slimmer as a whole. Sourcehut seems to fit that bill.
- **[Forked Ly for Void Linux—](https://github.com/doamatto/ly)** Ly is a display manager that didn't have a real way of working with Void, or the runit init system. I did some general porting to get it to work through the general build system.

## October
- **Participated in Hacktober 2021**
- **Started Michiru—** A small software initative for generally better software.
- **Started working on a homebrew calculator—** Along with [Daniel](https://cyckl.net), we set off to create a calculator by around this time next year that would be great to daily drive, while staying cheap enough to be practical.

## September
- **Recruited to Inkjar—** I lead the web design/development branch, as well as stay at the forefront of web administration. I maintain our webiste, along with our web and mail servers. 

## August
- **Hired part-time—** Joined the team at Chili's as a host to help save up for uni.
- **Released 5 different code experiments**

  - [**伏見 (Fushimi)—**](/projects/fushimi/) A simple webhook updated to keep remotes up-to-date on every push to Git
  - [**稲荷 (Inari)—**](/projects/maji/) A zero-config web server that gives sensible defaults and compression out-of-the-box.
- [**Wrote 1 blog post.**](/blog/electronics-are-following-the-wrong-law/) This was about ephemeralization (a word I still can't spell right the first time) and how we should start to shift gears to writing better code that works on lower-powered software.

## July
- **Wrote 2 blog posts:**
  - [**I don't know why we still have DRM**](/blog/idk-why-we-have-drm/)
  - [**Why analytics are a niche tool, not something everyone should use.**](/blog/why-analytics-are-a-niche-tool/)
- **Contracted by BlueJay—** [Jack](https://jackmerrill.com) contracted me to help out with some legal lingo, as well as some general bug- and pen- testing.

## June
- [**Redesigned and rewrote my site in Zola.**](https://github.com/doamatto/doamatto.xyz/pull/206) Previously using Next.js, this site netted some huge reductions and has helped make my site not only faster but also way more bearable to work with on any computer.

- [**Created the `vlang` pacakage for Chocolatey**](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/vlang)

## January
