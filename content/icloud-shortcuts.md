## ⚠️ Heads up!
This page is for a project that still has a GitHub repository. For this reason, this page will still start redirecting to its repository after 31 July, 2022. Redirects for this page will cease after 31 December, 2022. [The repository is `doamatto/icloud-shortcuts`.](https://github.com/doamatto/icloud-shortcuts/tree/main)

I create quite a lot of shortcuts to make Siri smarter and more useful for me, as well as just help out with the little things in life. These are all meant to be extended with things like smart home appliance (ie. turning on a humidifer) or with app integrations (ie. requesting work off through HotSchedules). 

## Adding these shortcuts
Because of some funky bug with Shortcuts, these are distrubted sanely (as of 2021-10-12). Because of such, you'll have to add me as a contact in your phone to add these shortcuts. It's as simple as making a contact with the email of `hello@doamatto.xyz`. If you prefer a one-click solution, you can add the contact directly by downloading the `vcard.vcf` file and using it to add the contact to your book.

Shortcuts and the VCF files are now hosted [on GitHub.](https://github.com/doamatto/icloud-shortcuts)
