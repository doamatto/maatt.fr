## Contact

There are a few ways you can contact me:
- via Instant Messaging on: 
  - [Keybase as @doamatto](https://keybase.io/doamatto) (E2EE)
  - [Twitter as @doamatto](https://twitter.com/doamatto) 
  - [Instagram as @doamatto](https://instagram.com/thetruedoormat)
  - Discord as @doamatto#1337[^1]
- via email: [`hello [at] doamatto.xyz`](mailto:hello@doamatto.xyz)[^2]

If you want to encrypt a message for me or validate that I am me[^3], my PGP key is [`7315 13B7 6DED 8009`](https://keybase.io/doamatto/pgp_keys.asc?fingerprint=58b953e7225f839c20ab2371731513b76ded8009)

You can request my CV via email or Keybase[^4].


[^1]: I have linked my GitHub and Twitter accounts on Discord to help with validating the right account.
[^2]: I employ certain precautions to help others ensure my emails are from me including: strict SPF records, MTA-STS, DKIM, and DMARC. If you aren't sure if you're actually talking to me, ask for me to sign a message with my PGP key or use one of the instant messaging services above.
[^3]: If you are sending me an email that is signed with my PGP key, it may take longer for me to respond to you. For faster (even instant wink), you should reach out to me via Keybase
[^4]: My CV is not for public viewing for the privacy reasons. The only reason you can request the CV via email or Keybase is a similar reason.
