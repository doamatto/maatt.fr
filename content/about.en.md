### Interests and hobbies

I am obsessed with learning and improvement. I use it as a way to keep myself constantly on my toes and learning more about things as popular as experimenting with Raspberry Pis to as niche as building custom keyboards. 

Formula 1 has also grown a spot in my heart. One of my favourite tracks is [Albert's Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Park_Circuit), but a close second would be [Nurburgring GP is solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BCrburgring) (the normal track is awesome too)

Outside of all that, I enjoy graphic design, as well as A/V editing. I've also been taking an interest in homelabbing, iPods, and Linux.
