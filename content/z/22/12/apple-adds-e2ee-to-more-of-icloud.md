Apple is adding end-to-end encryption to more iCloud services, namely: phone backups, iMessage backups, iCloud Drive, Notes, Photos, Reminders, Safari bookmarks, Siri shortcuts, Voice Memos, and Apple Maps. 

This is a good step in the right direction, but it only works on up-to-date Apple devices (iOS/iPadOS 16.2+, macOS Ventura, watchOS 9). I'm not ready to move to Ventura, so it's something I can't use (I only really use iCloud for syncing my feed reader, to be fair). It makes sense, but also there are some still supported versions (like Monterey) which could have gotten this in an update too.

A noticeable exclusion is Mail, Calendar, and Contacts, which remain not end-to-end encrypted so that you can still use IMAP/POP/SMTP and WebDAV (CalDAV and CardDAV, respectively).
