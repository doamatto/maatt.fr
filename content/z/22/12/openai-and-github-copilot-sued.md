Microsoft (by extension GitHub) and OpenAI are getting sued for violating copyright law because they keep stealing open-source code. It's seen as the first class-action suit challenging AI training and its output and, as Matthew Butterick puts it "will not be the last."

As someone who doesn't like seeing friends of mine's art get used and abused, I'm not a huge fan of the fact that this is growing to other means. Frankly, I'm not sure what a good solution *is* to this. Cease and desist is okay, it's hard to compensate every developer (especially once it reaches organisations), and just doing nothing, naturally, fixes nothing.

Good luck to everyone writing the laws for this one because I don't see the easy or best solution.
