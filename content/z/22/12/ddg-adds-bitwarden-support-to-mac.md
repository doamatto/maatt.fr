It's cool to see support for the FOSS password manager being added to DDG's browser. 1Password support may or may not be in the browser (I don't have the beta and I haven't seen anything on the front-page of a search to see it there; I'll stick with Firefox for the unforseeable future), but it would likely be one of the last things I would need to consider DDG's browser.

That and uBlock.

Maybe SponsorBlock.

Perhaps user-scripts.

Okay, so maybe I would need a few extensions.
