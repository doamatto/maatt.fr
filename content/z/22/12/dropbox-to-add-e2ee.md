Press release from [Boxcryptor](https://www.boxcryptor.com/en/blog/post/new-chapter-with-dropbox/)

---

Dropbox acquired Boxcrypto and is adding its support native to Dropbox. There's no timeline but Dropbox isn't going to dissolve Boxcryptor or merge their servers with Dropbox. One thing of note, however: New accounts and license purchases are no longer available.

It's really nice to see that Dropbox is adding end-to-end encryption, but I'm conflicted of them not letting potential new customers use Boxcryptor with other services than Dropbox (which it used to be able to do; OneDrive, SharePoint, and Google Drive, to name a few).
