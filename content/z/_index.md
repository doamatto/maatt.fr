These are quick "news" articles about things I find on the Internet. There is no schedule. There is occasionally opinions inserted. These are in a seperate paragraph from the actual news, which I do my best to vet but am only a person.

As for why this is `/z`, I couldn't use `/t` (T for Titbit) so I just picked a letter I will literally never use for anything ever. Watch that be a mistake somehow.

Think of these like similar blogs:
  - [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/)
  - [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/)
  - [Swiss Miss](https://www.swiss-miss.com/)
