Nintendo will now let you be disappointed in the amount you use your Switch with its year in review. It gives:
  - most played games,
  - your most frequently played,
  - the games you started this year; and:
  - at least for me, the game you've been playing for the past 3 years.

I don't use my Switch *too* often, so I had some basic results:
  - Most played: Mario Kart 8, Descenders, Life is Strange True Colors
  - Played for the past 3 years: Super Mario Odyssey
  - Started playing this year: Mario Kart 8, Descenders, Life is Strange True Colors

I dig it.
