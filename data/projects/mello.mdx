      It&quot;s super exciting to announce that Mello is being developed right now. I&quot;m working mostly on the Android app and the back-end, but still trying to help out where I can to make this go as smoothly as possible.

I’ve tried most all meditation apps, to be honest. Headspace was nice until you realised they lock almost all the content behind a paywall. Calm was not only expensive, but it followed the opposite approach of Headspace and had more content with varying levels of quality. I was a little upset about this and it made me wonder why we don’t have some free, or at the very least cheap, services that do the same thing. And like that, Mello was born.

Mello has all the things you download a meditation app for, plus a bit more to help you in the evening. Unlike basically every other app for meditation, sleep stories, or sound scapes, it’s free and doesn’t track you. It’s, as my mate [Daniel](https://cyckl.github.io) puts it, “your safe space, and we’re here to make sure it stays yours and yours alone.”

Our lead designer for the entire progress, Daniel, has been working hard to give a great interface that fits well with both iOS and Android, allowing little design confusion if you were to switch devices, for instance.

Myself and the lead iOS developer, [Lucas](https://ultra03.github.io), are both working hard to deliver this look and create an experience that you’ll love to use. As aforementioned though, Mello is private-by-default.

This means we follow a similar data principal to companies like Apple where we:
- encrypt as much as possible,
- collect as little as possible, and:
- be as transparent as possible.

Although I plan to write up a mock privacy policy soon that will show how data is handled, that’s not for a while. In the meantime, you’ll just have to listen to some [Lo-Fi beats to wind down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmVKaAV_7-A)
