    <p>
      Ever since I switched to Pop!_OS full-time, I haven&apos;t been able to play FiveM at all. So, I can&apos;t reliably develop new features anymore. However, because of the smashing community, I can still debug issues. Because of this, this tool has entered an End-of-Life state.

Most all of FiveM's loading screen mods have been, in my experience, poor looking and poor performing. Because of this, I made my own. With the absence of an original name, 5mLoading was born.

5mLoading is a feature-rich, customisable, and, most importantly, lightweight loading screen. Some key features being that:
- you can play music from YouTube playlists or SoundCloud while you wait for the game to load,
- you can see the current time locally, as well as how long you've been waiting to load into the server; and:
- server admins can easily customise everyting from the background to the text on the screen.

I got straight to work and released v0.1.0 on GitHub later that week. I made [a post of the official FiveM forums](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-5mloading-yet-another-loading-screen/1459768) that quickly achieved several hundred views, and has now amounted to, as of writing, almost five thousand views.

A lot of feedback came from here, as well as bug reports. It was a crucial tool and was great to talk with those who used my rather simple loading screen to better it. Over time, with patches and more features, v0.5.0 came out in December 2020.
