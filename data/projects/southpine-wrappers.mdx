  <Item status="eol" title="Transfered repositories to Glitch Entertainment" date="2020-10-16">
    Everyone decided it best to put these wrappers inside the Glitch Entertainment GitHub. Because of such, not only am I no longer in control of the code, but I also would have to mark this at the end of its life, due to virtually non-existent support for it currently.

While I did some freelance work at [Glitch Entertainment](https://playglitch.xyz), I worked on an API to interact with the player API and allow you to access things such as a player's level or integrate easily into tools like Discord's Rich presence SDK through a seperate client (if you wanted to do that for some reason).

When I left Glitch this year, I gave them both SouthNode (and SouthJS, the browser-compatible version) and SouthPy. Sadly, they haven't been improved any further.

# Privacy Statement
Your privacy is just as important as my privacy. And, per usual, I make it a commitment to ensure your data is handled properly and not in a privacy-friendly matter, rather a private-by-default manner.

**Data Collection:** I do not collect any data from any of the Southpine wrappers I have wrote. I do not employ any analytical tools that collect aggregated information. I do, however, employ a self-made error handling system that creates logs on errors and reports them to you. These logs do not contain any personally identifiable information. Logs are not automatically sent to GitHub, rather you have to manually publish them (which I do encourage so I can fix issues).

**Data Transfer/Selling/Sharing:** I don't collect any data (period), so I have no data to transfer or sell. However, when you provide logs via GitHub, you are publicly publishing them. If you have an issue with this, you can also send them to me via Keybase.

**Contact:** You can write to hello [at] doamatto.xyz to get help as swiftly as possible on amending or fixing this document, as well as get answers to questions regarding this policy.

**Policy Changes and Revisions:** By using the wrapper in your projects, you are affirming that you agree to this policy. If changes to this policy are made, I have no way of notifing you, so check back whenever you use these tools to re-read this policy.

**Last updated:** January 2nd, 2020
